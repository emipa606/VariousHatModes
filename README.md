안녕하세요! 고프니라고 합니다.
이번에 만든 모드는 모자모드 입니다.
바닐라에 이쁜모자가 별로 없는것 같아서, 이번기회에 만들어 보았습니다.
아무쪼록 모든 머리에 호환되도록 만들었으니 어떤림이 착용해도 이쁠꺼라는 자신이 있습니다!
아래에는 각 모자의 효과나 재료를 적어뒀으니 참고해 주시면 감사하겠습니다.
(High quality textures 사용을 권장합니다.)

Hi! It is called Goffney.
The mod created this time is the hat mode.
Vanilla doesn't seem to have a lot of pretty hats, so I made it this time.
We have made it compatible with all hair, so we have confidence that it will be pretty no matter what rim you wear!
Below, I have written down the effects and materials of each hat, so it would be appreciated if you could refer to it.
(High quality textures are recommended.)
